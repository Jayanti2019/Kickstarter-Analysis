#		**KickStarter Analysis Report**


## **Overview:**
Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Kickstarter dataset will be used for this analysis. 
Background:
Kickstarter dataset was used to help analyze which play came close to fundraising goal in a short amount of time. We will be using the same Kickstarter dataset to do the analysis for this report. We will also be creating some visualizations to help with our analysis.

##**Analysis**:

**Theatre Outcomes:**
After analyzing the data
1.	Most of successful outcomes are in the month of May
2.	Least successful outcomes are in the month of December
3.	Most of failed outcomes are in the month of October.
4.	Least failed outcomes are in the month of November
5.	Canceled outcomes are not changed much over campaign time.

**Outcomes Based on Goals:**

2.	Goal Amount 45000 to 49999 has the least amount of successful outcomes
3.	Goal amount less than 1000 has the least percentage of failed outcomes
4.	Goal Amount 45000 to 49999 has the least amount of failed outcomes

**Results:**

**Two conclusions about Theater Outcomes:**
1.	May is the most successful month as it has the most total outcomes.
2.	December is the least successful month as it has the least total outcomes. 
Conclusion about Goals outcomes:
1.	Less than 1000 Goals has the most successful outcomes.

**Some limitations of dataset:**

**Recommendation for Additional tables or graphs:**
1.	We can use Bar graphs or pie charts for this analysis.
